# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, playable in both the DOM and Console.

**Console Commands:**
- `game.playRound(row, col)` - e.g., `game.playRound(0, 0)` will mark the first cell.
- `game.printBoard()` - prints the current board state in the Console.
- `game.restartGame()` - restarts the game.

The DOM version allows you to interact with the game via a graphical interface, while the Console version provides text-based commands for gameplay
